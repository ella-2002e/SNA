- Identify Bridges: Detect nodes acting as bridges in the graph.
- Graph Density: Calculate and interpret the graph density.
- Node Connections: Highlight nodes with the highest and lowest connections.
- In- and Out-Degrees: Display nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.
- Centrality Measures: Identify nodes with the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality, interpreting the findings.
- Community Detection: Implement a community detection algorithm, showcasing the number of communities formed.
- Largest and Smallest Communities: Identify and interpret the largest and smallest communities.
- Community Visualization: Draw the three largest communities, remove top nodes based on centrality measures, and visualize each step.
- Influencer Visualization: Draw influencers within the top communities.
- Action Plan: Design a hypothetical action plan for a chosen business, considering budget and cost per action.
